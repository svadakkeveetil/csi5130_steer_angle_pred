# Subscribe the bag file image to read the sensor images
# Subscribe to the steering wheel angle of the bag file
# Pre process the image to send it to the NN model to predict the steering wheel angle
  # Understand the image format that is required for the model
# Send the image to the ML model to estimate the steering wheel angle
# Generate the SWA way to show it in the data
# Sync the image to make sure the image the estimate SWA are from the same time stamp
# play back the image to sync the image and the steering wheel angle
